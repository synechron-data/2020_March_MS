Broker Scale - The number of messages sent per second in the system.
Data Persistency - The ability to recover messages.
Consumer Capability – Whether the broker is capable of managing one-to-one and/or one-to-many consumers.


RabbitMQ (AMQP) - Best when you need Complex Routing

Scale: based on configuration and resources, the ballpark here is around 50K msg per second.

Persistency: both persistent and transient messages are supported.

One-to-one vs one-to-many consumers: both.



Kafka - Used when Large Amounts of Data

Scale: can send up to a millions messages per second.

Persistency: yes.

One-to-one vs one-to-many consumers: only one-to-many



Redis - Best used for Short-lived Messages

Scale: can send up to a million messages per second.

Persistency: basically, no – it’s an in-memory datastore.

One-to-one vs one-to-many consumers: both.
